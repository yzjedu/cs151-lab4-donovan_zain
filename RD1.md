# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Donovan Raymond
* Partner Full Name: 
* Student ID:  

Objective:

What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
1. String methods and formating
2. Decision making
3. Input validation with loops
4. Write my own algorithm, flowchart and control paths before coding

Procedure:
What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. I read and analyzed the readme
2. I planned and create an algorithm
3. I implemented my algorithm using python

What were the Key concepts explored?
We explored error checking and while loops the most in this lab.

Results:

Did your results match what you expected to get?
Yes we got exactly what we expected to recieve

Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
Zain wrote the test cases and we both worked to test our code 
and make sure it worked properply using the testcases excel

Reflection:

What challenges did you encounter?
we struggled to do error checking and with our while loops.

How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
1. I read and analyzed the readme
2. I planned and create an algorithm
3. I implemented my algorithm using python

Did you overcome them, and how?
Yes it took communication and sometime but we were able
Any key takeaways?
error checking is very important and tricky
Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
Yes I learned more about python and I became better at error checking and using while loops
What was it like working with your partner?
Working with my partner was great. He was a delight to work with.
