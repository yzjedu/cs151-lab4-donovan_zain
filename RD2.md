What was the goal?

The labs goal to help me practice with strings , decision-making, and input validation with loops.

Challenges:

Making sure users input the right package name was tricky. I had to use loops to keep asking until they got it right.

Balancing the program’s complexity while keeping it easy to use was a bit tough.

Also the directions on this one were very confusing. I coudlnt tell many things such as if we were calculatong the GB per month or if they had mutiple monthes in which they owed us ect....

What did I learn?

Loops are super usefull for checking if the user gives the right input.

Handling different input cases (like ‘GREEN’ or ‘green’) using string methods made the program more reliable.

Using if/else statements helped me structure the logic for calculating costs.

What was fun?

It was fun making an interactive program that’s user-friendly.

Creating a little scenario or story for the user was enjoyable.

Skills improved:

Better problem-solving, especially with input validation.

Learned to use string methods and format outputs neatly.

Got a better grip on using boolean logic and conditional statements.

Takeaways:

Planning the steps beforehand really helps.

Testing the program with different inputs is crucial to make sure it works right.

Clear and simple prompts make the program more user-friendly.

Overall experience:

This lab was a good mix of practice and creativity. It helped me get better at working with user inputs and making decisions in code. The whole project was challenging but also rewarding, and it definitely helped me be a better programmer.
